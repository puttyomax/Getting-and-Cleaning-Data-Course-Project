# Getting-and-Cleaning-Data-Course-Project

##Background
This set of files were created as an assignments for a Coursera-program called "Getting and Cleaning Data".
According to the given directions, "run_analysis.R" above needs to do tasks below:

1. Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
2. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
3. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
4. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
5. From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

##Data
Data has been downloaded&unzipped in a folder of "~/Desktop/R/coursera/tidying data/UCI HAR Dataset" from "https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip"
